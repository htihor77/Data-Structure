SRE Change Governance Process Flow:This appears to be a flow for managing changes within the SRE team or platform governance. It involves:Requestor Initiates Change: The requestor creates a change.CTASK Creation: A CTASK (change task) is created to track the change.Tracker Sharing & Review: The governance team creates a tracker and shares it with the engineering team for review.Eng Team Review: The engineering team reviews the change and either approves or rejects it.Change Approval Process:Approved changes move forward for further discussion or approval in ECAB/TCAB (Engineering or Technical Change Advisory Board).Rejected changes go back to the requestor for corrections.Implementation & Closure: Once the change is approved, it moves to a scheduled state, is implemented, and the task is closed.SRE Opened Production Change Flow:This flow seems to relate specifically to managing production changes, involving:Requestor Initiates Change: A change is requested (likely within an SRE environment).CTASK Assignment: The governance team assesses the change and assigns it to a change assignment group (CAG).Review & Authorization: The change is reviewed and authorized by ECAB/TCAB, and after authorization, it is scheduled.Implementation: The scheduled changes are implemented (by MW or DB teams, as noted).Review and Closure: After implementation, the change is reviewed, and the case is closed.



Plan to Build a React and Node.js Application Based on the Process:Requirement Analysis and Planning:Understand the process flow and break it down into a set of features for a web-based application.Define user roles (e.g., SRE Requestor, Governance Team, Engineers, CAG Team).Establish the key modules (CTASK creation, Change review, Scheduling, Implementation tracking, Approval, and Closure).Backend Development (Node.js/Express):Step 1: Setup Backend Environment:Install Node.js and create a new project using npm init.Install Express for routing (npm install express).Step 2: Define REST API Endpoints:Implement endpoints for handling requests such as:/createChange: To create new changes./assignTask: To create a CTASK and assign it to the engineering team./reviewChange: For the engineering team to review, approve, or reject./scheduleChange: To move approved changes to a scheduled state./implementChange: To track implementation./closeChange: To close the task after implementation.Step 3: Database Integration:Use a database like MongoDB for tracking changes, approvals, and user roles.Define schemas (e.g., for changes, approvals, and tasks).Step 4: Authentication:Implement JWT-based authentication for user login and role-based access control.Frontend Development (React):Step 1: Setup Frontend Environment:Create a React application using npx create-react-app.Step 2: UI Components:Build components for each part of the process flow:A form to Create a Change.A dashboard for Governance Team to manage and track requests.A review page for Engineers to approve/reject changes.A scheduling and implementation tracker for CAG Teams.Step 3: State Management & API Integration:Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and API integration with the Node.js backend.For global state, you can use Context API or Redux.Step 4: Implement Routing:Use React Router to create different pages (e.g., Change Request, Task Review, Approval).Step 5: Form Handling and Validation:Use form libraries like Formik for handling form submissions and validation (e.g., when creating changes).Testing:Use Jest and React Testing Library for frontend testing.Use Mocha/Chai for backend unit and integration tests.Deployment and CI/CD:Use Docker for containerization.Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.Deploy the backend using services like Heroku or AWS and the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.Maintenance:Implement logging (using libraries like winston) and monitoring tools like Prometheus for tracking application performance and errors in production.Ensure automatic rollbacks in case of failed deploymen



Dashboard Purpose:Track and Manage Changes: The dashboard would be used by different teams (Requestors, Governance, Engineering, etc.) to create, review, approve, and track the status of changes in a production environment.Role-Based Access: Different users (SRE requestors, engineers, governance teams) would have access to specific features based on their roles, such as creating new changes, approving them, or marking them as implemented.Key Features for a Dashboard:Change Request Form: A section where SRE requestors can submit new change requests (aligned with your first step in the process flow).Change Tracker: A place for the governance team to monitor the status of changes and approve or reject them. This could include a list of pending and completed changes, as well as comments or reviews.Approval Workflow: For the engineering team to review, comment, approve, or reject changes, as seen in your diagrams.Implementation Status: An area for the implementation teams to update and close changes after they have been executed.
